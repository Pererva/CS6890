# AI Supported Maximum PowerPoint Tracking in Microbial Fuel Cell
Final Project in CS6980: Advanced Intelligent System in Clean Energy
Spring 2017

# Abstract
Project addresses challenge of extracting maximum power from microbial fuel cells (MFCs). AI-based approach, that involves use of Convolutional Neural Network (NN), was developed and compared with standard technique called “Disturb & Observe” (D&O).

# Introduction
Microbial Fuel Cell is an Bio-Electro-Chemical device that utilize exo-electrogenic abilities of certain bacteria strains in order to:
- Produce the electricity in external circuit
- Simultaneous removal of organics / pollutants
